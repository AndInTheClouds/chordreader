# Chord Reader
ChordReader is an app that fetches chord charts and tabulatures for your favorite songs from the Internet, saves them, and displays them in an easy-to-read format with the chords highlighted.  The identified chords can also be transposed up or down, or you can add a capo.  It's good for changing the key of a song to fit your vocal range.

# Status
This is a fork of the abandoned ChordReader app by Nolan Lawson, which I needed to fix, so I could use it. It works with ultimate-guitar.com now.
